"""barehands server — serves the hand-tracked air-board on localhost.

localhost = a secure context, which is what lets the browser open your
camera for the tracker page. Nothing here ever leaves your machine.

Endpoints:
  GET  /stage.html, /media/*   the pages + the media airlock
  POST /state                  tracker's ~45Hz scene heartbeat; the response
                               carries queued commands (the command channel)
  GET  /state                  the render page mirrors the scene from here
  POST /cmd                    board commands (your AI -> the board)
  GET  /config                 the barehands.json config (name + orbs)
  GET  /tree?orb=N             a notes orb's folder tree — read-only, JAILED
  GET  /note?f=N/<rel>         one note's text — read-only, JAILED
  GET  /props                  the media airlock as a browsable tree
  GET  /orb                    your assistant's live state (the ring reads it)

Config lives in barehands.json next to this file:
  { "name": "Assistant", "port": 8794,
    "orbs": [ { "title": "Notes", "path": "sample-notes", "kind": "notes" },
              { "title": "Props", "path": "media",        "kind": "media" } ] }

"notes" orbs may point at ANY folder of markdown (an Obsidian vault is
just a folder of markdown). The "media" orb may point anywhere too, so
your props can stay where they already live; a relative path resolves
against the repo. Wherever it points is the airlock: the only place
images and models ever stage from.

Your AI drives the ring by writing tiny files into ./state/ :
  state/state      one word: idle | listening | thinking | speaking
  state/mood.json  {"mood": "green"|"amber"|"red", "ts": <unix time>}
  state/wave.json  {"samples": [0..1 x 64], "ts": <unix time>}
Missing files are fine — the ring just idles.
